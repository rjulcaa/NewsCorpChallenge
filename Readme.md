This project uses a VIPER architecture, so it is neccesary that every interaction between different components should be through protocols (Dependencies)
 
The only external dependecy that this projects uses is Kingfisher to load images from URl and to use cache to store the images

The data access layer uses URLSession to fetch from the server
